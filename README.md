# KMer
K-mer counting by python3
# K-mer counting

This is DNA k-mer counting module, which could convert multiple DNA sequence in a fasta file and it can easily transfer to count amino acid.

[KMer_function.py](https://github.com/JingBoZhou/KMer/blob/master/KMer_function.py) is a function format of DNA k-mer counting, you can easily to change it for your own purpose.

[KMer_class.py](https://github.com/JingBoZhou/KMer/blob/master/KMer_class.py) is DNA k-mer counting class module.

[KMer_example_py2.ipynb](https://github.com/JingBoZhou/KMer/blob/master/KMer_example_py2.ipynb) is a example of my module which is using python2, in this example I wrote my module step by step.

[KMer_example_py3.ipynb](https://github.com/JingBoZhou/KMer/blob/master/KMer_example_py3.ipynb) is a example of my module which is using python3, in this example I wrote my module step by step.

[example.txt](https://github.com/JingBoZhou/KMer/blob/master/example.txt) is a example DNA sequence file(using fasta format)
